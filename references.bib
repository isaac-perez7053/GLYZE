	abstract = {Fats and oils are found in many food products; however, their macroscopic properties are difficult to predict, especially when blending different fats or oils together. With difficulties in sourcing specific fats or oils, whether due to availability or pricing, food companies may be required to find alternative sources for these ingredients, with possible differences in ingredient performance. Mathematical and computational modeling of these ingredients can provide a quick way to predict their properties, avoiding costly trials or manufacturing problems, while, most importantly, keeping the consumers happy. This review covers a range of mathematical models for triacylglycerides (TAGs) and fats, namely, models for the prediction of melting point, solid fat content, and crystallization temperature and composition. There are a number of models that have been designed for both TAGs and fats and which have been shown to agree very well with empirical measurements, using both kinetic and thermodynamic approaches, with models for TAGs being used to, in turn, predict fat properties. The last section describes computational models to simulate the behavior of TAGs using molecular dynamics (MD). Simulation of TAGs using MD, however, is still at an early stage, although the most recent papers on this topic are bringing this area up to speed.},

In this study, the underlying parameter set is improved to deliver more physically consistent predictions, i.e., increasing melting point and enthalpy of fusion with increasing stability of the polymorphs, without deterioration of the primary model quality to describe the available experimental data. Interestingly, when a curated dataset containing only thermodynamically consistent data is compared to a broader dataset, it appears that the model’s efficacy is highly dependent on the quantity of data, specifically the number of unsaturated triglycerides data. Quality and thermodynamic consistency of model predictions and the condition of a reliable description of monoacid triglycerides as a subset is discussed, addressing a potential interdependence.},

Triglycerides represent an interesting class of esters as the main constituents of animal and vegetable fats, with attractive thermal properties. In order to be used as PCMs, the thermal behaviour of triglycerides has to be fully understood, as in some cases they have been reported to show polymorphism and supercooling. This study assesses the suitability of triglycerides as PCMs by reviewing the literature published so far on their behaviour and properties. In particular, melting points, enthalpies of fusion, polymorphism, thermal conductivities, heat capacities and thermal cycling stabilities are considered, with a focus on LHS and thermal energy storage applications. In addition, the efforts conducted regarding modelling and the prediction of melting points and enthalpies based on chemical structures are summarized and assessed.},

	abstract = {Tri-isoamyl phosphate (TiAP) has been proposed to be an alternative for tri-butyl phosphate (TBP) in the Plutonium Uranium Extraction (PUREX) process. Recently, we have successfully calibrated and tested all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulations using Mulliken partial charges for pure TiAP, TBP, and dodecane by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It is of immense importance to extend this potential for the various molecular properties of TiAP and TiAP/n-dodecane binary mixtures using MD simulation. Earlier, efforts were devoted to find out a suitable force field which can explain both structural and dynamical properties by empirical parameterization. Therefore, the present MD study reports the structural, dynamical, and thermodynamical properties with different mole fractions of TiAP-dodecane mixtures at the entire range of mole fraction of 0–1 employing our calibrated Mulliken embedded optimized potentials for liquid simulation (OPLS) force field. The calculated electric dipole moment of TiAP was seen to be almost unaffected by the TiAP concentration in the dodecane diluent. The calculated liquid densities of the TiAP-dodecane mixture are in good agreement with the experimental data. The mixture densities at different temperatures are also studied which was found to be reduced with temperature as expected. The plot of diffusivities for TiAP and dodecane against mole fraction in the binary mixture intersects at a composition in the range of 25\%-30\% of TiAP in dodecane, which is very much closer to the TBP/n-dodecane composition used in the PUREX process. The excess volume of mixing was found to be positive for the entire range of mole fraction and the excess enthalpy of mixing was shown to be endothermic for the TBP/n-dodecane mixture as well as TiAP/n-dodecane mixture as reported experimentally. The spatial pair correlation functions are evaluated between TiAP–TiAP and TiAP–dodecane molecules. Further, shear viscosity has been computed by performing the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics employing the periodic perturbation method. The calculated shear viscosity of the binary mixture is found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental values. The use of the newly calibrated OPLS force field embedding Mulliken charges is shown to be equally reliable in predicting the structural and dynamical properties for the mixture without incorporating any arbitrary scaling in the force field or Lennard-Jones parameters. Further, the present MD simulation results demonstrate that the Stokes-Einstein relation breaks down at the molecular level. The present methodology might be adopted to evaluate the liquid state properties of an aqueous-organic biphasic system, which is of great significance in the interfacial science and technology.},

Many physical properties of such products, incl. morphology, texture and rheology, are determined by the phase behaviour of the included TAGs. Triglycerides are also of special interest for the production of solid lipid nanoparticles, applied for controlled drug delivery and for encapsulation of bioactive ingredients. In this paper, we study the polymorphic behaviour of complex TAG mixtures, composed of 2 to 6 mixed TAGs, by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray scattering techniques, aiming to reveal the general rules for their phase behaviour upon cooling and heating. The results show that two or more coexisting phases form upon solidification (α, β’ and/or β), the number of which depends strongly on the cooling rate and on the number of components in the mixture. No completely miscible α- or β’-phases were observed. The structure of the most stable β polymorphs, formed upon subsequent heating of the solidified samples, does not depend on the thermal history of the samples. For all mixtures studied, we observed one-component β domains, coexisting with binary mixed β domains with composition and structure which do not depend on the specific TAG ratio in the mixture. In other words, for a mixture with k saturated TAGs we observed (2k-1) different β phases. These conclusions provide some predictive power when analysing the phase transition properties of TAG mixtures.},

	abstract = {Triacylglycerols (TAGs) exhibit a monotropic polymorphism, forming three main polymorphic forms upon crystallization: α, β’ and β. The distinct physicochemical properties of these polymorphs, such as melting tem­ perature, subcell lattice structure, mass density, etc., significantly impact the appearance, texture, and long-term stability of a wide range products in the food and cosmetics industries. Additionally, TAGs are also of special interest in the field of controlled drug delivery and sustained release in pharmaceuticals, being a key material in the preparation of solid lipid nanoparticles. The present article outlines our current understanding of TAG phase behavior in both bulk and emulsified systems. While our primary focus are investigations involving monoacid TAGs and their mixtures, we also include illustrative examples with natural TAG oils, highlighting the knowledge transfer from simple to intricate systems. Special attention is given to recent discoveries via X-ray scattering techniques. The main factors influencing TAG polymorphism are discussed, revealing that a higher occurrence of structural defects in the TAG structure always accelerates the rate of the α → β polymorphic transformation. Diverse approaches can be employed based on the specific system: incorporating foreign molecules or solid particles into bulk TAGs, reducing drop size in dispersed systems, or using surfactants that remain fluid during TAG particle crystallization, ensuring the necessary molecular mobility for the polymorphic transformation. Furthermore, we showcase the role of TAG polymorphism on a recently discovered phenomenon: the creation of nanoparticles as small as 20 nm from initial coarse emulsions without any mechanical energy input. This analysis underscores how the broader understanding of the TAG polymorphism can be effectively applied to comprehend and control previously unexplored processes of notable practical importance.},

It is therefore very useful to have predictive models for these properties. Triglycerides can crystallize into three different polymorphic forms which are a Žhexagonal., bX Žorthorhombic. and b Žtriclinic.. A group contribution method ŽGC-method. has been developed for predicting the melting point and the enthalpy of fusion for each polymorphic form of the saturated triglycerides, which have an even number of carbon atoms Žbetween 10 and 22. in each acyl group. The GC-method is based on the fact that a triglyceride can be described as consisting of two terminal acyl groups and one median acyl group. Thus, the parameters in the GC-method describe next to which terminal acyl groups the median acyl group is located, the GC-method takes into account the position of the acyl groups in the triglyceride and the class which the triglyceride belongs to. The GC-method predicts both the melting point and the enthalpy of fusion better than the existing models. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Neutral lipids (NLs) are an abundant class of cellular lipids. They are characterized by the total lack of charged chemical groups in their structure, and, as a consequence, they play a major role in intracellular lipid storage. NLs that carry a glycerol backbone, such as triacylglycerols (TGs) and diacylglycerols (DGs), are also involved in the biosynthetic pathway of cellular phospholipids, and they have recently been the subject of numerous structural investigations by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. However, conﬂicting results on the physicochemical behavior of NLs were observed depending on the nature of the atomistic force ﬁeld used. Here, we show that current phospholipid-derived CHARMM36 parameters for DGs and TGs cannot adequately reproduce interfacial properties of these NLs because of excessive hydrophilicity at the glycerol-ester region. By following a CHARMM36-consistent parameterization strategy, we develop improved parameters for both TGs and DGs that are compatible with both cutoff-based and particle mesh Ewald schemes for the treatment of Lennard-Jones interactions. We show that our improved parameters can reproduce interfacial properties of NLs and their behavior in more complex lipid assemblies. We discuss the implications of our ﬁndings in the context of intracellular lipid storage and NLs' cellular activity.},

In this study, the underlying parameter set is improved to deliver more physically consistent predictions, i.e., increasing melting point and enthalpy of fusion with increasing stability of the polymorphs, without deterioration of the primary model quality to describe the available experimental data. Interestingly, when a curated dataset containing only thermodynamically consistent data is compared to a broader dataset, it appears that the model’s efficacy is highly dependent on the quantity of data, specifically the number of unsaturated triglycerides data. Quality and thermodynamic consistency of model predictions and the condition of a reliable description of monoacid triglycerides as a subset is discussed, addressing a potential interdependence.},

	abstract = {Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are one of the main forms of energy storage in living organisms. Natural fats, which are nothing but the multicomponent TAG systems, are widely used in industrial products such as food, medicine and cosmetics. Industrial demands promote the studies on thermophysical properties of the multicomponent TAG systems for a long time; however, the whole picture of their phase behavior is yet to be drawn. With a view to understand the complicated phase behavior of natural fats, I have investigated on the physical mixtures of TAGs by Raman spectroscopy. Firstly, the background of this study is introduced (Chapter 1). Raman spectroscopy is the appropriate method to characterize TAGs, particularly when they exist in multicomponent systems. The structure and phase behavior of TAGs are then summarized with emphasis on the recent developments (Chapter 2). The interesting phase properties of TAGs, polymorphism and“molecular compound”formations, are introduced. The factors affecting these phase properties, such as crystallization conditions, are also mentioned. Next, the spectral features of TAGs are described in relation to their phase specific structures (Chapter 3). On the basis of the accumulated spectroscopic data, Raman spectroscopy has contributed to reveal the detailed structure of TAG polymorphs. Based on the knowledge described in these chapters, two TAG systems are studied. They include a TAG binary system that is known to form a molecular compound (Chapter 4) and several natural fats that are widely used in industrial products (Chapter 5).},

              In this study, 10 different vegetable oils were oxidized at four different isothermal temperatures (383, 393, 403, and 413 K) in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The protocol involved oxidizing vegetable oils in a DSC cell with oxygen flow. A rapid increase in evolved heat was observed with an exothermic heat flow appearing during initiation of the oxidation reaction. From this resulting exotherm, the onset of oxidation time (
              T
              o
              ) was determined graphically by the DSC instrument. In our experimental data, linear relationships were determined by extrapolation of the log (
              T
              o
              ) against isothermal temperature. The rates of lipid oxidation were highly correlated with temperature. In addition, based on the Arrhenius equation and activated complex theory, reaction rate constants (

              Kinematic viscosity (
              µ
              ) is an important physical property of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and biodiesel. In this work, the Martin's rule of free energy additivity is extended to cover the kinematic viscosity of saturated and unsaturated FAME commonly found in nature. The proposed model can also be extended to estimate kinematic viscosity of biodiesel. The kinematic viscosity of a FAME or a biodiesel can be easily estimated from its carbon number (
              z
              ), number of double bonds (
              n
              d
              ) at different temperatures (
              T
              ) without a prior knowledge of the viscosity of individual FAME. Both

              n
              d(ave)
              can be derived from its fatty acid composition. Thus, kinematic viscosity of biodiesel at temperatures between 20 and 100 °C and at atmospheric pressure can be estimated. The average absolute deviation (AAD) estimated at 20–100 °C for saturated, unsaturated FAME, biodiesels and biodiesel blends are 4.15, 3.25, 6.95 and 2.79 \%, respectively. The biodiesels collected in this study (191 data points) have the

              between 14.10 and 17.96 and 0.21–1.54, respectively. The standard deviation was 0.249. The proposed model would be good for estimation of viscosity of biodiesel containing normal fatty acids, generally found in biodiesel feed stocks.},

Molecular interactions between the components were investigated and found to be weak. Additionally, the predictive capability of the PC-SAFT equation of state was evaluated for density calculations. The binary interaction parameter, assumed constant over the temperature range, was fitted using experimental excess molar volume data at each temperature. The PC-SAFT model accurately predicted the experimental densities of the mixtures. Furthermore, two viscosity models were applied and accurately fitted to the experimental data.},

              Kinematic viscosity (
              µ
              ) is an important physical property of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and biodiesel. In this work, the Martin's rule of free energy additivity is extended to cover the kinematic viscosity of saturated and unsaturated FAME commonly found in nature. The proposed model can also be extended to estimate kinematic viscosity of biodiesel. The kinematic viscosity of a FAME or a biodiesel can be easily estimated from its carbon number (
              z
              ), number of double bonds (
              n
              d
              ) at different temperatures (
              T
              ) without a prior knowledge of the viscosity of individual FAME. Both
              z
              ave
              and
              n
              d(ave)
              can be derived from its fatty acid composition. Thus, kinematic viscosity of biodiesel at temperatures between 20 and 100 °C and at atmospheric pressure can be estimated. The average absolute deviation (AAD) estimated at 20–100 °C for saturated, unsaturated FAME, biodiesels and biodiesel blends are 4.15, 3.25, 6.95 and 2.79 \%, respectively. The biodiesels collected in this study (191 data points) have the
              z
              ave
              and
              n
              d(ave)
              between 14.10 and 17.96 and 0.21–1.54, respectively. The standard deviation was 0.249. The proposed model would be good for estimation of viscosity of biodiesel containing normal fatty acids, generally found in biodiesel feed stocks.},

The databank used for regression of the group contribution parameters (1070 values for 65 types of substances) included fatty compounds, such as fatty acids, methyl and ethyl esters and alcohols, tri- and diacylglycerols, and glycerol. The inclusion of new experimental data for fatty esters, a partial acylglycerol, and glycerol allowed for a further reﬁnement in the performance of this methodology in comparison to a prior group contribution equation (Ceriani, R.; Gonc-alves, C.

Besides, the inﬂuence of small concentrations of partial acylglycerols, intermediate compounds in the transesteriﬁcation reaction, in the viscosity of biodiesels was also investigated.},

The measurements were performed in Cannon Fenske glass capillary kinematic viscometers. The contents of a large data bank, containing viscosity data for saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated pure fatty substances, were correlated by an equation based on the number of carbon atoms and double bonds. By using this equation for pure compounds and the UNIMOD group contribution method for mixtures, the viscosity data for model fatty systems, commercial oleic acid, and canola oil were predicted. The good results obtained in the present work indicate that this approach can be a valuable tool for designing or evaluating chemical process equipment for the oil industry.},

In this study, we are presenting the development, and validation, of a new force field (FF), which we have called the COarse-Grained Interchangeable Triacylglyceride-Optimized FF. The FF has been developed using both a bottom-up and top-down approach for different parameters, with the non-bonded parameters being optimized using a Bayesian optimization method. While the FF was developed using monounsaturated TAGs, results show that it is also suitable for fully saturated TAGs. Description of molecules which were not used during the development of the FF is carried out simply by interchanging the bead in the molecule topologies. Results show that the FF can reproduce the macroscopic properties (density and lattice parameters) of pure TAGs as both crystals and melt with high accuracy, as well as reproduce the differences in enthalpies.},
